                <br>- Lead vocalist of The Bees Knees</h3>
            <h3 class="about__subheading">The Bees Knees</h3>
            <p class="about__text">The Bees Knees is a pop rock band originating 
                from San Francisco, California. The band 
                consists a dynamic lineup featuring two lead 
                vocalists, two guitarists, a bassist, a 
                keyboardist and a drummer. The band 
                achieved its first commercial success as an 
                unsigned act, drawing attention from their 
                future manager. Having extensive experience 
                working with both new and seasoned acts, the 
                manager was confident the band could 
                succeed even further with more support, 
                pushing The Bees Knees to sign with a well 
                known record label.</p>
            <p class="about__text">From there, the band has soared, gaining 
                international recognition and ranking in the 
                top 10 on the Poster Charts. New fans 
                immediately fell in love with the band&apos;s original 
                and organic attitude, solidifying their place as 
                one of the hottest and fastest up and coming 
                acts of this century. Fans affectionately refer to 
                themselves as &quot;The Hive&quot; and are drawn to 
                their candid and authentic performances on 
                stage. The Bees Knees are currently recording 
                their second studio album, looking to be 
                released in early 2024.</p>
